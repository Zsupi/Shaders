### 01_Blob 🔵

* Distorted spheres are rendered using signed distance functions and ray marching.
* The spheres are blend together with smooth min function. You can find more information about smooth min functions in this article: [link](https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/)
* The amount of steps the ray went before hitting the blobs is used to brighten the edges.
